This is my first 'real' node.js application. We used node.js and javascript in an environment other then an browser. I thought this would be a straight forward assignment. I was wrong. I had a hard time getting everything to talk to each other. I tried to hide my keys from the general public. This caused me a lot of grief. I found keeping everything in order took more time then needed. It was a really good learning experience. There is so much to keep track of. There were multiple times when I confused myself. The trick was to write one line at a time. I learned to outline what I wanted to do. Made this so much easier.
